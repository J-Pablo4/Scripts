| [CVE-2012-0114] Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL 5.0.x, 5.1.x, and 5.5.x allows local users to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors.
| [CVE-2012-0113] Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL 5.1.x and 5.5.x allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality and availability via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-0118.
| [CVE-2012-0112] Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL 5.1.x and 5.5.x allows remote authenticated users to affect availability via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-0115, CVE-2012-0119, CVE-2012-0120, CVE-2012-0485, and CVE-2012-0492.
| [CVE-2012-0075] Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL 5.0.x, 5.1.x, and 5.5.x allows remote authenticated users to affect integrity via unknown vectors.
| [CVE-2011-5049] MySQL 5.5.8, when running on Windows, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted packet to TCP port 3306.
| [CVE-2011-2262] Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL 5.1.x and 5.5.x allows remote attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors.
| [CVE-2010-3839] MySQL 5.1 before 5.1.51 and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via multiple invocations of a (1) prepared statement or (2) stored procedure that creates a query with nested JOIN statements.
| [CVE-2010-3838] MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.92, 5.1 before 5.1.51, and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a query that uses the (1) GREATEST or (2) LEAST function with a mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments, which is not properly handled when the function's result is "processed using an intermediate temporary table."
| [CVE-2010-3837] MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.92, 5.1 before 5.1.51, and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a prepared statement that uses GROUP_CONCAT with the WITH ROLLUP modifier, probably triggering a use-after-free error when a copied object is modified in a way that also affects the original object.
| [CVE-2010-3836] MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.92, 5.1 before 5.1.51, and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and server crash) via vectors related to view preparation, pre-evaluation of LIKE predicates, and IN Optimizers.
| [CVE-2010-3835] MySQL 5.1 before 5.1.51 and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (mysqld server crash) by performing a user-variable assignment in a logical expression that is calculated and stored in a temporary table for GROUP BY, then causing the expression value to be used after the table is created, which causes the expression to be re-evaluated instead of accessing its value from the table.
| [CVE-2010-3834] Unspecified vulnerability in MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.92, 5.1 before 5.1.51, and 5.5 before 5.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash) via vectors related to "materializing a derived table that required a temporary table for grouping" and "user variable assignments."
| [CVE-2010-3833] MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.92, 5.1 before 5.1.51, and 5.5 before 5.5.6 does not properly propagate type errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via crafted arguments to extreme-value functions such as (1) LEAST and (2) GREATEST, related to KILL_BAD_DATA and a "CREATE TABLE ... SELECT."
| [CVE-2009-4484] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the CertDecoder::GetName function in src/asn.cpp in TaoCrypt in yaSSL before 1.9.9, as used in mysqld in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.90, MySQL 5.1.x before 5.1.43, MySQL 5.5.x through 5.5.0-m2, and other products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and daemon crash) by establishing an SSL connection and sending an X.509 client certificate with a crafted name field, as demonstrated by mysql_overflow1.py and the vd_mysql5 module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.11. NOTE: this was originally reported for MySQL 5.0.51a.
| [CVE-2006-4835] Bluview Blue Magic Board (BMB) (aka BMForum) 5.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to (1) footer.php, (2) header.php, (3) db_mysql_error.php, (4) langlist.php, (5) sendmail.php, or (6) style.php, which reveals the path in various error messages.
