| [CVE-2005-1344] Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 2.0.52 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long realm argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.

| [CVE-2004-2680] mod_python (libapache2-mod-python) 3.1.4 and earlier does not properly handle when output filters process more than 16384 bytes, which can cause filter.read to return portions of previously freed memory.
| [CVE-2004-2650] Spooler in Apache Foundation James 2.2.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering various error conditions in the retrieve function, which prevents a lock from being released and causes a memory leak.
| [CVE-2004-2343] ** DISPUTED ** Apache HTTP Server 2.0.47 and earlier allows local users to bypass .htaccess file restrictions, as specified in httpd.conf with directives such as Deny From All, by using an ErrorDocument directive. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, since the .htaccess mechanism is only intended to restrict external web access, and a local user already has the privileges to perform the same operations without using ErrorDocument.
| [CVE-2004-2336] Unknown vulnerability in Novell GroupWise and GroupWise WebAccess 6.0 through 6.5, when running with Apache Web Server 1.3 for NetWare where Apache is loaded using GWAPACHE.CONF, allows remote attackers to read directories and files on the server.

| [CVE-2004-0490] cPanel, when compiling Apache 1.3.29 and PHP with the mod_phpsuexec option, does not set the --enable-discard-path option, which causes php to use the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable to find and execute a script instead of the PATH_TRANSLATED variable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code as other users via a URL that references the attacker's script after the user's script, which executes the attacker's script with the user's privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0529.
| [CVE-2004-0488] Stack-based buffer overflow in the ssl_util_uuencode_binary function in ssl_util.c for Apache mod_ssl, when mod_ssl is configured to trust the issuing CA, may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a client certificate with a long subject DN.

NOTE: the PHP developer has disputed this vulnerability, saying "The opened file descriptors are opened by Apache. It is the job of Apache to protect them ... Not a bug in PHP."
| [CVE-2003-1172] Directory traversal vulnerability in the view-source sample file in Apache Software Foundation Cocoon 2.1 and 2.2 allows remote attackers to access arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the filename parameter.

| [CVE-2003-0249] ** DISPUTED **  PHP treats unknown methods such as "PoSt" as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."

| [CVE-2002-2103] Apache before 1.3.24, when writing to the log file, records a spoofed hostname from the reverse lookup of an IP address, even when a double-reverse lookup fails, which allows remote attackers to hide the original source of activities.

| [CVE-2002-1793] HTTP Server mod_ssl module running on HP-UX 11.04 with Virtualvault OS (VVOS) 4.5 through 4.6 closes the connection when the Apache server times out during an SSL request, which may allow attackers to cause a denial of service.
| [CVE-2002-1658] Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long user argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-1635] The Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) in Oracle 9i Application Server (9iAS) uses a Location alias for /perl directory instead of a ScriptAlias, which allows remote attackers to read the source code of arbitrary CGI files via a URL containing the /perl directory instead of /cgi-bin.
